Simon Game with jquery

This is a web version of the popular game Simon. Rules are simple

1. There are four tiles (Red, Green, Blue and Black). Press any keyboard key to start.
2. In every level, one random tile is highlighted.
3. A player has to remember the sequence of all tiles shown upto current level and select the correct sequence by clicking on the tiles. For example, if red is highlighted in level 1 and green in level 2, level 1 sequence is just red, but level 2 sequence is red from level 1 and green from level 2.
4. Game ends when a wrong sequence is selected in a level.

There is no leadboard or statistics as this is a front-end only application created with Jquery. No data is stored.
